## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Visio parsing complexity | High | Medium | Research phase, multiple parser libraries |
| Performance at scale | High | Medium | Load testing, horizontal scaling design |
| Integration challenges | Medium | High | Well-defined APIs, extensive testing |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security audit, penetration testing |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Clear PRD, change control process |
| Resource availability | High | Medium | Cross-training, documentation |
| Market competition | Medium | Medium | Unique features, fast time-to-market |
| User adoption | High | Low | Beta program, user feedback loops |
